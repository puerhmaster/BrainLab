# Welcome to BrainLab

This website presents a comprehensive study on optimizing protocols for generating cerebral organoids using the chimpanzee cell line Sandra (batches b1711 and b2711). Our research integrates morphological measurements, gene expression analyses, and microscopy observations to understand how subtle variations in culture conditions—such as neuroinduction timing, embedding day, anti-apoptotic treatment, and retinoic acid supplementation—affect organoid development and forebrain specification.

## Abstract

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the Sandra cell line batches b1711 and b2711. We integrate morphological data (average perimeter measurements and growth rates) with gene expression profiles for key neural markers (EMX1, FOXG1, PAX6, and SOX2). By comparing different culture conditions and variations in protocol timings, we elucidate how external cues and intrinsic batch differences shape organoid maturation, growth, and forebrain specification.

## Introduction

Organoid technology enables the recapitulation of key aspects of early neural development in a three-dimensional culture system. The Sandra cell line, grown under various protocols, serves as a valuable model for investigating the effects of protocol modifications on tissue expansion and neural differentiation. Key experimental modifications include:

- **Neuroinduction Timing (NIM4 vs. NIM5):** Switching from mTeSR to neuroinduction medium at day 4 or day 5 post-seeding.
- **Anti-apoptotic Compounds (PSC vs. CEPT):** Using different inhibitors to enhance cell survival.
- **Embedding Day (E8 vs. E9):** Embedding embryoid bodies in Matrigel at day 8 or day 9 to support ventricle formation.
- **Retinoic Acid Addition (RA14 vs. RA15):** Adding vitamin A at day 14 or day 15 to influence cortical differentiation.
