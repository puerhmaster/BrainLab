# Analysis and Results

This document presents the detailed integrated analysis of the Sandra cell line batches b1711 and b2711. The study combines morphological measurements with gene expression profiling to evaluate the impact of different protocol parameters on cerebral organoid development.

## Abstract

We integrated morphological data (average perimeter measurements and growth rates) with qPCR-based gene expression analysis for key neural markers (EMX1, FOXG1, PAX6, and SOX2). By comparing various conditions—differing in neuroinduction timing, embedding day, anti-apoptotic treatment, and retinoic acid supplementation—we assess how these factors influence organoid maturation, growth, and forebrain specification.

## 1. Introduction

Organoid technology allows the modeling of early neural development in a three-dimensional system. The Sandra cell line, cultured under varying conditions, serves as a model to study how protocol modifications affect tissue expansion and neural differentiation. This analysis focuses on two experimental batches:
- **Batch b1711:** Variations in embedding day and retinoic acid addition.
- **Batch b2711:** Comparisons of neuroinduction timing (NIM4 vs. NIM5) and anti-apoptotic treatments (PSC vs. CEPT).

## 2. Materials and Methods

### 2.1 Organoid Culture and Conditions

Organoids were generated using the following variations:
- **Neuroinduction:** Switching to NIM on either day 4 (NIM4) or day 5 (NIM5).
- **Anti-apoptotic Treatment:** Use of PSC versus CEPT.
- **Embedding:** Performed on day 8 (E8) or day 9 (E9).
- **Retinoic Acid:** Addition on day 14 or day 15.

### 2.2 Morphological Measurements

Daily perimeter measurements were taken from day 1 to day 9 to assess growth dynamics:
- Early days (1–3) capture initial neuroepithelial formation.
- Days 5–7 show significant expansion, indicative of progenitor proliferation.
- Differences between batches highlight the influence of embedding timing and treatment variations.

### 2.3 Gene Expression Analysis

Gene expression was quantified via qPCR for the following markers:
- **EMX1:** A marker for cortical neuron identity.
- **FOXG1:** Indicative of forebrain patterning.
- **PAX6:** Associated with neural progenitor proliferation.
- **SOX2:** A marker for neural stemness and progenitor maintenance.

#### 2.3.1 Overall Expression Profiles

Baseline expression levels were established and compared across experimental conditions. Subtle variations provide insight into the balance between proliferation and differentiation.

#### 2.3.2 Condition-Specific Comparisons

- **Batch b1711:** Later embedding (day 9) and later retinoic acid addition (day 15) correlate with increased expression of EMX1, suggesting enhanced cortical commitment.
- **Batch b2711:** Organoids under E9 conditions treated with PSC exhibit higher FOXG1 expression, indicating robust forebrain specification. Variations in PAX6 and SOX2 further delineate differences in progenitor dynamics.

## 3. Results

### 3.1 Morphological Dynamics

- **Average Perimeter:**  
  Organoid perimeters increased from approximately 1.5 to 3.5 units, with significant growth observed between days 5 and 7.
- **Rate of Change:**  
  Rapid expansions coincide with critical developmental stages, with batch-specific differences suggesting an impact from both the embedding day and neuroinduction timing.

### 3.2 Gene Expression Trends

- **EMX1:**  
  Generally low (~0.00–0.03), but elevated in conditions with later retinoic acid addition.
- **FOXG1:**  
  Moderately expressed (up to ~0.3), with higher levels in PSC-treated organoids.
- **PAX6:**  
  Robust expression (up to ~2.0), reflecting active progenitor proliferation.
- **SOX2:**  
  Consistent expression (~0.025–0.125), confirming a stable progenitor pool.

## 4. Discussion

The integrated analysis demonstrates that protocol variations—especially in embedding day, neuroinduction timing, and retinoic acid supplementation—significantly influence both morphological and molecular outcomes. Batch-specific responses underscore the importance of initial cell conditions and highlight the need for statistical analysis across multiple organoids per condition to better understand differentiation efficiency.

Future studies should expand sample sizes and explore additional markers to refine the understanding of cerebral organoid development.
