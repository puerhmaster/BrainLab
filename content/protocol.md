## 2. Introduction

Cerebral organoids are three-dimensional multicellular structures derived from pluripotent stem cells that mimic aspects of brain development. This protocol describes an unguided method for generating cerebral organoids from iPSCs, allowing spontaneous formation of dorsal forebrain–like areas. The method is applicable for research into embryonic brain development and neurodevelopmental disorders.

  - Heparin (1 mg/mL): 50 µL  

- **DM -A or +A (50 mL):**  
  - DMEM/F12: 24 mL  
  - Neurobasal: 25 mL  
  - B27 -A or +A: 500 µL  
  - N2 supplement: 250 µL  
  - MEM NEAA (100x): 250 µL

- **CET+P (or CEPT):**  
  - CET: 1:4000 dilution  
  - Polyamine: 1:1000 dilution  

### 3.3 Plastics and Disposables

- 96-well ultralow attachment plates

- Parafilm
- Sterile scissors, forceps, pipette tips
- Neubauer chamber or automated cell counter

### 3.4 Equipment

- Laminar Flow Hood
- Incubator (37°C, 5% CO2, 95% humidity)
- Centrifuge (capable of 300 ×g)
- Orbital Shaker (65 rpm)

## 4. Pre-Protocol Considerations

1. Ensure iPSCs show minimal spontaneous differentiation and are mycoplasma-free.
2. Passage cells to reach ~80% confluency on the day of seeding.
3. Maintain strict sterile technique using 70–80% ethanol.

## 5. Detailed Protocol

### 5.1 Timeline Overview

Refer to the provided schematic for an overview of the production timeline.

### 5.2 Stage I: Cell Cultivation and Seeding (Day 0)

#### 5.2.1 Stem Cell Cultivation
- Grow iPSCs in appropriate culture conditions and monitor for 80% confluency.

#### 5.2.2 Dissociation of iPSCs
1. Aspirate the medium from 80–90% confluent cells.
2. Rinse with DPBS.
3. Add 400 µL of Accutase; incubate at 37°C for 5–7 minutes.
4. Verify cell detachment under a microscope.
5. Stop the reaction with 1 mL prewarmed DMEM/F12.
6. Gently pipette to create a single cell suspension.

#### 5.2.3 Harvesting and Counting Cells
1. Transfer suspension to a 15 mL tube.
2. Centrifuge at 300 ×g for 5 minutes.
3. Aspirate supernatant; resuspend pellet in 2 mL DMEM/F12.
4. Count cells using a Neubauer chamber or cell counter.

#### 5.2.4 Seeding into 96-Well Plate
1. Adjust cell density to 9,000 cells per 150 µL.
2. Dispense 150 µL into each well of an ultralow attachment plate.
3. Incubate at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 48 hours.

#### 5.2.5 Media Change Technique (2 Days Post Seeding)
1. Tilt the plate so embryoid bodies (EBs) collect to one side.
2. Aspirate 100 µL of medium gently with a P200 pipette.
3. Add 150 µL of fresh iPSC culture medium (without PSC).

### 5.3 Stage II: Embryoid Body Growth
- Change medium every other day.
- Monitor EBs for smooth, spherical appearance (typical size ~150–300 µm by days 4–5).

### 5.4 Stage III: Neuroinduction
- For human/chimpanzee EBs, replace most of the medium with 150 µL of Neuroinduction Medium (NIM) on day 5.

### 5.5 Stage IV: Embedding in Basement Membrane Matrix (Days 7–9)
1. Thaw Matrigel on ice.
2. Create dimples on a piece of Parafilm placed over a pipette tip rack.
3. Gently transfer one EB per dimple.
4. Add cold Matrigel droplets to cover each EB.
5. Incubate at 37°C for 15–30 minutes to polymerize.
6. Invert the Parafilm onto a dish containing fresh differentiation medium (DM).

### 5.6 Stage V: Retinoic Acid Addition and Ventricle Formation (Days 13–15+)
1. Switch to differentiation medium supplemented with retinoic acid on day 13–15.
2. Monitor organoid development, particularly ventricle formation and growth dynamics.
